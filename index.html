  <h2 id="about">About MassOS</h2>
  <p>MassOS is a free (as in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank">freedom</a>) GNU/Linux operating system for laptops and desktops which is designed to be minimal and lightweight, without compromising on features.</p>
  <p>MassOS uses a themed <a href="https://xfce.org" target="_blank">Xfce</a> desktop environment. This allows it to be lightweight on system resources while still being visually appealing and easy to use.</p>
  <p>MassOS is completely independent and not based on any existing GNU/Linux distribution. This means we are free from being tied down to distributions outside of our control.</p>
  <p>With a 2 gigabyte USB flash drive, you can use the Live ISO to try out MassOS without making any changes to your computer, and see if it's right for you before you decide to fully install it onto your PC. If you do decide to install it, you can install it alongside your current operating system, or replace it entirely.</p>
