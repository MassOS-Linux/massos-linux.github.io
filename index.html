      <h2>About MassOS</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>MassOS is an independent GNU/Linux operating system for x86_64 laptops and desktops, which is designed to be minimal and lightweight, without compromising on features.</p>
        <p>MassOS primarily ships with a themed Xfce desktop environment, designed to be lightweight and easy on system resources, while still feeling modern, as well as being intuitive and easy-to-use. Xfce is also highly customizable for users who want the ability to make the operating system truly their own. Screenshots of MassOS can be found on the <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots page</a>.</p>
        <p>Unlike thousands of other distributions, MassOS is built from scratch, and is not a derivative of any existing GNU/Linux distribution. This means it is free from being tied down to workings and practises of existing distributions, and is not reliant on other distributions to be able to provide updates. MassOS follows a rapid release schedule and aims to provide the latest and greatest versions of the most widely used software on GNU/Linux systems.</p>
        <p>With a 4 gigabyte USB flash drive, you can use the Live ISO to try out MassOS without making any changes to your computer, and see if it's right for you before you decide to fully install it onto your PC. If you do decide to install it, you can install it alongside your current operating system, or replace it entirely.</p>
        <p>If you're ready to get started, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/MassOS-Linux/MassOS/wiki/Installing-MassOS" target="_blank">installation guide</a>.</p>
